Account :
=========
1.Business Account
2.Person Account.

Account & Contact Management : 
===============================
=> Account and Contact both are standard Salesforce Objects.
=> Account Objects store the information about the companies with which an organization is doing business.
=> Contact Object stores information about people those are working with companies whose information is stored in Account.

In Salesforce, the Ownership field on an Account object is typically used to track the ownership status of the account within the organization. It provides information about who within the organization is responsible for managing the account.
The Ownership field on the Account object in Salesforce typically has a standard set of picklist values. These values help to classify the ownership status of the account. The standard options available are:

Public: Indicates that the account is publicly traded or owned by a publicly listed company.

Private: Indicates that the account is privately held and not publicly traded.

Subsidiary: Used when the account is a subsidiary of a larger parent company.

Other: A catch-all option for ownership types that don't fall into the other categories.

Unknown: Used when the ownership status of the account is not known.

These are the standard values, but Salesforce administrators can customize the picklist to add, remove, or modify these values based on the specific needs of their organization.


Account & Contact RelationShip :
=================================

=> Relationship between companies(accounts) and the people who work  at them (Contacts).
=> one person can be associated with multiple companies.
    -> contacts to multiple Accounts.

=> Junction object : Account Contact RelationShip.


person Account :
===============

=> Solo contractor or an individual consumer.
=> can use special type i.e. person Account.
=> person account won't have their own contact.
Note : once person Account enabled in the org. 2 record types of aaccount will be created. 
Once Person Account enabled can't be disabled.

considerations :
-----------------
=>Person Accounts count against both account and contact storage, because each person account consists of one account and one contact.
=>Person Accounts can't be included in account hierarchies, contact hierarchies, or have direct relationships with other accounts or contacts. However, you can use Contacts to Multiple Accounts to create indirect relationships between a person account and another person account, business account, or contact.
=>Creating or editing a person account triggers account workflow rules.
=>Contact fields from person accounts will continue to be exposed on account list views and reports even if your org stops using person accounts.
