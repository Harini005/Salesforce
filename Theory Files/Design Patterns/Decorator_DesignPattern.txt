=> Decorator Pattern :
==========================

It attempts to solve the issue where you need temporary fields for processing(typically in Visualforce/LWC/Aura/APex) but do not need to add these fields to the Sobject.

Common uses for this pattern include:
======================================

1. Selection Checkbox - a list of records that the user selects and applies behaviour to; the selection checkbox is not saved.
2. Calculated fields - a complex read-only value cannot be easily done in formula field (e.g. calculation of a check digit)
3. wrapper class - when we wanted to store the data from the object to temporarily in the class.
